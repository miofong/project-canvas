## How To Use
The functions mentioned above have a default font-size of ***\*12\**** and a default font-style of ***\*Arial\**** with a default ink of ***\*Black\**** color.

The font-size range can be adjusted to the users preference and can either choose to use mouse to drag it over or simply use arrow keys for easier usage.

There's two more font-style available other than the default one.

Color can also be changed according to the users need.

For the rest of the functions, user can simply just click on the icon and start getting creative! Whenever an icon is clicked, it will stay "lit" so the one using can always look back to check which function they are/were using.
